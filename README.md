# Logo Designs
This repository is for CTDA logo designs used for the web sites and other marketing/outreach activities.

## About the logo ##
This logo was designed by Erik Lindsay in an effort to create a brand for CTDA that embodied everything that CTDA stands for. Starting with the motto "Connect. Preserve. Share." Connect and share are represented with the lines connecting all the circles, symbolizing the web of knowledge within the archive that is shared among its users. Preserve comes into play by putting the white circles within the larger red circle, much like putting something in a box to save for later. The white is not completely contained, however, because the artifacts are meant to be looked at, and taken out of the box every now and then. The font Ikaros was used because of it melds together the old and new aspects of CTDA. It is a plain sans serif, which aligns with today's modern design, but the letters forms have an Art Deco vibe to them, giving it links to the past. 


Logo Usage
----
 1. Whenever possible use the transparent .SVG or .PNG versions. 
 2. Be sure to use black and white versions when printing in black and white.
 3. The vertical logo should only be used in cases where the horizontal
    version does not fit.
